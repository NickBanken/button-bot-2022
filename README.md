# Discord Button Bot

⚠️ Currently in beta

New button bot: Pinging selected roles from promotions in order to remind them to push the button on mybecode.org.


The original bot was build by the amazing Manuele. His version was deprecated so we made a new one with Discordjs V13 and Nodejs V16.

## Tools and resources

* Core code : here.
* Replit hosting : https://replit.com/@basileLeroy/button-bot-backend#app.js

  * Auto updated from Github repository
* Cron-job (pinging bot): Currently only access for Basile - still looking for a better option
